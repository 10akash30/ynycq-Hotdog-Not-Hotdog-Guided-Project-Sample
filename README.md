# Launch A Hotdog Not Hotdog Web App (Sample Project)!
In this repository, you'll find all the completed files and folders needed to build and launch your web app with Python.

As part of the project, you would have modified the `app.py` file and the `config.py` file, both of which can be found in the **app** folder. Feel free to take a look at those files to see how they were modified!
